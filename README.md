Loan Default Analysis

A company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default. The company can utilize this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

In this case study, we would use Exploratory Data Analysis to understand how consumer attributes and loan attributes influence the tendency of default.

Approach to the Loan Default analysis: 

STEP 1: Data understanding and Data Cleaning

STEP 2: Univariate Analysis

STEP 3: Bivariate Analysis
